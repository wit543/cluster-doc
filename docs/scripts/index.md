# Cluster Scripts

This section contains scripts useful for cluster administration.

The repository uses [Terminalizer](https://github.com/faressoft/terminalizer)
in the GitHub Actions workflow to automatically generate animated demos from
terminal output. See `demo_sinfo.sh` for an example.

Because this Codex environment cannot record real terminals, `docs/images/sinfo-demo.gif`
is only a small text placeholder. When you run the workflow yourself,
Terminalizer will generate the actual animation and overwrite the placeholder image.
