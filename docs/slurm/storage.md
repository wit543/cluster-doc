# Storage and File Systems

### Home and Scratch

Your home directory is backed up and should be used for important files
and scripts. Scratch space provides larger, high-performance storage for
running jobs and temporary data.

### Best Practices

- Run jobs from scratch to avoid filling home quotas.
- Clean up large files when they are no longer needed.
- Keep personal backups of critical data.
- Check your quota with `lfs quota /scratch/$USER` if available.

More details about the storage layout are available from the
[cluster storage guide](https://example.com/cluster-storage).
