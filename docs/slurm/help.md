# Getting Help

### Documentation

Slurm provides extensive manual pages. For example:

```bash
man sbatch
```

You can view help for most commands with the `--help` flag, and the
official documentation is available online at
[https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html).

Additional guides may be found on the cluster website.

### Contact Support

If you encounter problems, email `cluster-support@example.com` or open a
support ticket through the service portal. Include your job ID and any
error messages to help staff diagnose the issue.
