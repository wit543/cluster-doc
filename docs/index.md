# Welcome to the Cluster Documentation

This site provides documentation for both normal users and system administrators.

Use the navigation bar at the top to browse available topics. You can contribute updates through the integrated CMS or by editing Markdown files directly.

Fonts are loaded to support both English and Thai content. Syntax-highlighted code blocks and a search box make it easy to find what you need.
The theme automatically switches between light and dark modes based on your system preference.
